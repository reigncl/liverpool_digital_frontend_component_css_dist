/*
  Design Tokens Nomenclature
  ======
  For design, the design tokens with the key 'fill' in the code correspond to 'bg'. Both refer to the background of the element. On the other hand,
  the key 'content' in the design system pertains to all the content or elements within the element. In code,
  it is handled as 'fill'. This is something that can be changed in the future. In Figma,
  it's preferable for designers to refer to them as 'fill' and 'content', while in code, it makes more sense to call them 'bg' and 'fill'
